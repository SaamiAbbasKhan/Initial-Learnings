# Learnings
Contains simple projects that helped me in mastering the stack.

## Tagging System
There will be categorized system of projects, based on complexity, ranging from simple to advanced. I use a tagging system to denote the level of each project:

s1, s2, s3: Simple projects, covering fundamental programming concepts.
i1, i2, i3: Intermediate projects, involving more complex logic and features.
a1, a2, a3: Advanced projects, utilizing advanced programming techniques and patterns.

## ** a3 > a2 > a1 > i3 > i2 > i1 > s3 > s2 > s1**
## <---------------------------------------------- Flow
